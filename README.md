## How it works
Follow the on screen prompts to about learn our animals and make donations. 

## How to run?
Go to the frontend folder, then unzip `env.zip` to get the `.env` file, and run `npm install && npm run dev`. Then open another terminal and go to the payments folder and unzip `env.zip`, then run `npm install && node app.js`.

## Learnings
We learnt how to use the Interledger OpenPayments API as well as OpenAI API to create a robust donation application for the SPCA.

## Achievements
Storing the state of a transaction between the beginning of an interaction and the response to the interaction

## What comes next?
Expanding on what is there. In future, we would like to add a drives button, which will act as events for people to donate to as well.
